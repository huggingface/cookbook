        "# Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook explores solutions for streamlining the deployment of models from a model registry. For teams that want to productionize many models over time, investments at this \"transition point\" in the AI/ML project lifecycle can meaningful drive down time-to-production. This can be important for a younger, smaller team that may not have the benefit of large swathes of existing infrastructure in place to form a \"golden path\" for serving online models in production.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Optimizing this stage of the model lifecycle is particularly important due to the production-facing aspect of the end result. At this stage, your model becomes, in effect, a microservice. This means that you now need to contend with all elements of service ownership, which can include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Standardizing and enforcing API backwards-compatibility;\n",
        "- Logging, metrics, and general observability concerns;\n",
        "- Etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Needing to repeat the same general-purpose setup each time you want to deploy a new model will result in development costs adding up significantly over time for you and your team. On the flip side, given the \"long tail\" of production-model ownership (assuming a productionized model is not likely to be decommissioned anytime soon), streamlining investments here can pay healthy dividends over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given all of the above, we motivate our exploration here with the following user story:\n",
        "\n",
        "> I would like to deploy a model from a model registry (such as [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/)) using **only the name of the model**. The less boilerplate and scaffolding that I need to replicate each time I want to deploy a new model,the better. I would like the ability to dynamically select between different versions of the model without needing to set up a whole new deployment to accommodate those new versions.\n"
