    "# RAG with source highlighting using Constrained generation\n",

    "\n",
    "**Constrained generation** is a method that forces the LLM output to follow certain constraints, for instance to follow a specific pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has numerous use cases:\n",
    "- ✅ Output a dictionnary with specific keys\n",
    "- 📏 Make sure the output will be longer than N characters\n",
    "- ⚙️ More generally, force the output to follow a certain regex pattern for downtream processing.\n",
    "- 💡 Highlight sources supporting the answer in Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate specifically the last use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "**➡️ We build a RAG system that not only provides an answer, but also highlights the supporting snippets that this answer is based on.**\n",
