    "To generate the instruction dataset, we will use the [HF Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/en/index) integrated with distilabel. These Inference Endpoints are provided by Hugging Face and allow to easily deploy and run transformers, diffusers or any available model from the Hub on a dedicated and autoscaling infrastructure. You can find more information on how to create your first endpoint [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/guides/create_endpoint).\n",

    "\n",
    "Inference endpoints are a solution, managed by Hugging Face, to easily deploy any Transformer-like model. They are built from models on the Hugging Face Hub. Inference endpoints are handy for making inference on LLMs without the hassle of trying to run the models locally. In this tutorial, we will use inference endpoints to generate text using our Notus model, as part of the `distilabel` workflow. The endpoint of choice has a [Notus 7B instance](https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/argilla/endpoints/aws-notus-7b-v1-4052) running.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's dive into this quick example of how to use an inference endpoint. We have prepared an easy `TextGenerationTask` to ask questions to the model, in a very similar way as we talk with the LLMs using chatbots. First, we define a class for the question-answering task, with functions showing `distilabel` how the model should generate the prompts, parse the input and the output, etc."
