        "Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) is a **prompt engineering technique to reduce hallucinations!** An LLM generates a baseline response to a user query, but this might contain errors. CoVe helps by creating a plan comprising of verification questions that are used to validate the information. This process results in more accurate answers than the initial response. The final answer is revised based on these validations. **[ Link to Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11495.pdf)**\n",
