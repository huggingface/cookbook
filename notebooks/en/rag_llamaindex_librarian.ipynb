    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to quickly build a RAG-based \"librarian\" for your\n",
    "local ebook library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the last time you visited a library and took advantage of the\n",
    "expertise of the knowledgeable staff there to help you find what you need out of\n",
    "the troves of textbooks, novels, and other resources at the library. Our RAG\n",
    "\"librarian\" will do the same for us, except for our own local collection of\n",
    "ebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "We'd like our librarian to be **lightweight** and **run locally as much as\n",
    "possible** with **minimal dependencies**. This means that we will leverage\n",
    "open-source to the fullest extent possible, as well as bias towards models that\n",
    "can be **executed locally on typical hardware, e.g. M1 Macbooks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution will consist of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [LlamaIndex], a data framework for LLM-based applications that's, unlike\n",
    "  [LangChain], designed specifically for RAG;\n",
    "- [Ollama], a user-friendly solution for running LLMs such as Llama 2 locally;\n",
    "- The [`BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5)\n",
    "  embedding model, which performs [reasonably well and is reasonably lightweight\n",
    "  in size](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard);\n",
    "- [Llama 2], which we'll run via [Ollama].\n",

    "1. **Loading**, in which you tell LlamaIndex where your data lives and how to\n",

    "## Conclusion and Future Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "We've demonstrated how to build a basic RAG-based \"librarian\" that runs entirely locally, even on Apple silicon Macs. In doing so, we've also carried out a \"grand tour\" of LlamaIndex and how it streamlines the process of setting up RAG-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, we've really only scratched the surface of what's possible here. Here are some ideas of how to refine and build upon this foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forcing Citations\n",
    "\n",
    "To guard against the risk of our librarian hallucinating, how might we require that it provide citations for everything that it says?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Extended Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "Ebook library management solutions like [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) create additional metadata for ebooks in a library. This can provide information such as publisher or edition that might not be readily available in the text of the book itself. How could we extend our RAG pipeline to account for additional sources of information that aren't `.epub` files?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficient Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to collect everything we built here into a script/executable, the resulting script would re-index our library on each invocation. For our tiny test library of two files, this is \"fine,\" but for any library of non-trivial size this will very quickly become annoying for users. How could we persist the embedding indices and only update them when the contents of the library have meaningfully changed, e.g. new books have been added?"
