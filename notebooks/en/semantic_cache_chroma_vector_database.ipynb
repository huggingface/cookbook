        "In this notebook, we will explore a typical RAG solution where we will utilize an open-source model and the vector database Chroma DB. **However, we will integrate a semantic cache system that will store various user queries and decide whether to generate the prompt enriched with information from the vector database or the cache.**\n",
        "\n",
        "A semantic caching system aims to identify similar or identical user requests. When a matching request is found, the system retrieves the corresponding information from the cache, reducing the need to fetch it from the original source.\n",
        "\n",
        "As the comparison takes into account the semantic meaning of the requests, they don't have to be identical for the system to recognize them as the same question.  They can be formulated differently or contain inaccuracies, be they typographical or in the sentence structure, and we can identify that the user is actually requesting the same information.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, queries like **What is the capital of France?**, **Tell me the name of the capital of France?**, and **What The capital of France is?** all convey the same intent and should be identified as the same question.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the model's response may differ based on the request for a concise answer in the second example, the information retrieved from the vector database should be the same. This is why I'm placing the cache system between the user and the vector database, not between the user and the Large Language Model.\n",

        "Most tutorials that guide you through creating a RAG system are designed for single-user use, meant to operate in a testing environment. In other words, within a notebook, interacting with a local vector database and making API calls or using a locally stored model.\n",
        "\n",
        "This architecture quickly becomes insufficient when attempting to transition one of these models to production, where they might encounter from tens to thousands of recurrent requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "One way to enhance performance is through one or multiple semantic caches. This cache retains the results of previous requests, and before resolving a new request, it checks if a similar one has been received before. If so, instead of re-executing the process, it retrieves the information from the cache.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a RAG system, there are two points that are time consuming:\n",
        "* Retrieve the information used to construct the enriched prompt:\n",
        "* Call the Large Language Model to obtain the response.\n",
        "\n",
        "In both points, a semantic cache system can be implemented, and we could even have two caches, one for each point.\n",
        "\n",
        "Placing it at the model's response point may lead to a loss of influence over the obtained response. Our cache system could consider \"Explain the French Revolution in 10 words\" and \"Explain the French Revolution in a hundred words\" as the same query. If our cache system stores model responses, users might think that their instructions are not being followed accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "But both requests will require the same information to enrich the prompt. This is the main reason why I chose to place the semantic cache system between the user's request and the retrieval of information from the vector database.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, this is a design decision. Depending on the type of responses and system requests, it can be placed at one point or another. It's evident that caching model responses would yield the most time savings, but as I've already explained, it comes at the cost of losing user influence over the response.\n"

They protect against things like measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough). Immunizations are important for adults as well as children.    Your immune system helps your body fight germs by producing substances to combat them. Once it does, the immune system \"remembers\" the germ and can fight it again. Vaccines contain germs that have been killed or weakened. When given to a healthy person, the vaccine triggers the immune system to respond and thus build immunity.     Before vaccines, people became immune only by actually getting a disease and surviving it. Immunizations are an easier and less risky way to become immune.

The symptoms of SD can vary from a halting gait and slight grimacing to involuntary movements that are frequent and severe enough to be incapacitating. The random, writhing movements of chorea are caused by an auto-immune reaction to the bacterium that interferes with the normal function of a part of the brain (the basal ganglia) that controls motor movements.
