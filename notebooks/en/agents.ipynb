    "## 2. 📚💬 RAG with Iterative query refinement & Source selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick definition: Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) is ___“using an LLM to answer a user query, but basing the answer on information retrieved from a knowledge base”.___\n",
    "\n",
    "This method has many advantages over using a vanilla or fine-tuned LLM: to name a few, it allows to ground the answer on true facts and reduce confabulations, it allows to provide the LLM with domain-specific knowledge, and it allows fine-grained control of access to information from the knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now let’s say we want to perform RAG, but with the additional constraint that some parameters must be dynamically generated. For example, depending on the user query we could want to restrict the search to specific subsets of the knowledge base, or we could want to adjust the number of documents retrieved. The difficulty is: **how to dynamically adjust these parameters based on the user query?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A frequent failure case of RAG is when the retrieval based on the user query does not return any relevant supporting documents. **Is there a way to iterate by re-calling the retriever with a modified query in case the previous results were not relevant?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🔧 Well, we can solve the points above in a simple way: we will **give our agent control over the retriever's parameters!**\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ Let's show how to do this. We first load a knowledge base on which we want to perform RAG: this dataset is a compilation of the documentation pages for many `huggingface` packages, stored as markdown.\n"
