    "\n",
    "These *tools* are basically functions that the LLM couldn't perform well by itself: for instance for a text-generation LLM like [Llama-3-70B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct), this could be an image generation tool, a web search tool, a calculator...\n",
    "\n",
    "What is **Transformers Agents**? it's an extension of our `transformers` library that provides building blocks to build your own agents! Learn more about it in the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/transformers_agents).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to use it, and which use cases it can solve.\n",

    "## 📚💬 Retrieval-Augmented Generation with source selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick definition: Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) is “using an LLM to answer a user query, but basing the answer on information retrieved from a knowledge base”. It has many advantages over using a vanilla or fine-tuned LLM: to name a few, it allows to ground the answer on true facts and reduce confabulations, it allows to provide the LLM with domain-specific knowledge, and it allows fine-grained control of access to information from the knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s say we want to perform RAG, but with the additional constraint that some parameters must be dynamically generated. For example, depending on the user query we could want to restrict the search to specific subsets of the knowledge base, or we could want to adjust the number of documents retrieved. The difficulty is: **how to dynamically adjust these parameters based on the user query?**\n",
    "\n",
    "🔧 Well, we can solve this by in a simple way: we will **give our agent control over these parameters!**\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ Let's show how to do this. We first load a knowledge base on which we want to perform RAG: this dataset is a compilation of the documentation pages for many `huggingface` packages, stored as markdown.\n"
