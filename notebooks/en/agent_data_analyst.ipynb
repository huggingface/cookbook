Correlation between Pclass and survival rate: -0.338\\nInsight: Passengers from lower socio-economic backgrounds were less likely to survive.\\n2. Correlation between age and survival rate: -0.077\\nInsight: Older passengers were slightly less likely to survive.\\n3. Correlation between family size and survival rate: 0.017\\nInsight: Passengers traveling with larger families were slightly more likely to survive, but this correlation is very weak and may not be significant.\\n\\n**Summary of Correlations and Trends**\\n\\nThe analysis of the Titanic dataset reveals several interesting trends and correlations. Firstly, the socio-economic status of passengers played a significant role in their survival, with passengers from lower socio-economic backgrounds being less likely to survive. Secondly, age was a weak predictor of survival, with older passengers being slightly less likely to survive. Finally, family size had a very weak positive correlation with survival rate, suggesting that passengers traveling with larger families were slightly more likely to survive, but this correlation is very weak and may not be significant.\\n\\n**Plots**\\n\\n(Attached are the plots generated using matplotlib/seaborn and saved to the './figures/' folder)\\n\\nI hope this meets the requirements!\"}.\u001b[0m\n",
