    "# Optimizing Language Models with DSPy GEPA\n",
    "\n",
    "_Authored by: [Behrooz Azarkhalili](https://github.com/behroozazarkhalili)_\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use DSPy's GEPA (Generalized Error-driven Prompt Augmentation) optimizer to improve language model performance on mathematical reasoning tasks. We'll work with the NuminaMath-1.5 dataset and show how GEPA can boost accuracy through automated prompt optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll learn:**\n",
    "- Setting up DSPy with language models (OpenRouter) \n",
    "- Processing and filtering mathematical problem datasets\n",
    "- Building a baseline Chain-of-Thought reasoning program\n",
    "- Optimizing prompts with GEPA using error-driven feedback\n",
    "- Evaluating improvements in model accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "GEPA works by analyzing errors, generating targeted feedback, and automatically refining prompts to address common failure patterns. This makes it particularly effective for complex reasoning tasks where prompt quality significantly impacts performance."

    "**Main LM: `openrouter/openai/gpt-4.1-nano`**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Primary Role:* High-volume inference during baseline evaluation and GEPA optimization iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "*Key Selection Criteria:*\n",
    "1. **Cost Efficiency** - $0.10/M input tokens, $0.40/M output tokens (~90% cheaper than GPT-4.1 or Claude)\n",
    "2. **Low Latency** - Fastest GPT-4.1 variant, enables rapid iteration with 16-32 parallel threads\n",
    "3. **Adequate Performance** - 60-65% baseline accuracy (MMLU: 80.1%, GPQA: 50.3%)\n",
    "4. **Context Window** - 1M tokens for long chain-of-thought reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reflection LM: `openrouter/qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-thinking`**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Primary Role:* Deep error analysis and prompt improvement during GEPA's reflection phase\n",
    "\n",
    "*Key Selection Criteria:*\n",
    "1. **Advanced Reasoning** - \"Thinking\" variant specialized for analytical reasoning and pattern identification\n",
    "2. **Quality Over Speed** - ~16 reflection calls vs 2000+ inference calls, can afford slower, higher-quality model\n",
    "3. **Context Handling** - 10M token context window for processing multiple training examples\n",
    "4. **Cost Trade-off** - More expensive per token but negligible total cost due to low volume\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture Philosophy:** Use a cheap, fast model for high-volume inference (99% of calls) and a smart, analytical model for low-volume reflection (1% of calls). This asymmetric design optimizes for both cost efficiency and learning quality."

    "### Understanding the Baseline Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation table shows our model's performance on 90 test problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Table Columns:**\n",
    "- `problem`: The mathematical question from NuminaMath-1.5\n",
    "- `example_answer`: Ground truth answer\n",
    "- `reasoning`: Model's chain-of-thought reasoning process\n",
    "- `pred_answer`: Model's final prediction\n",
    "- `metric`: ✔️ indicates correct answer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "- **Baseline Accuracy: ~52%** - The model gets roughly half the problems correct\n",
    "- **Reasoning Quality**: The model generates coherent step-by-step reasoning (see the `reasoning` column)\n",
    "- **Common Failures**: \n",
    "  - Calculation errors (e.g., row 0: predicted 4.8 minutes vs correct 14.4 minutes)\n",
    "  - Misinterpreting problem statements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "This baseline performance demonstrates that while GPT-4.1 Nano has reasonable mathematical reasoning capability, there's significant room for improvement. GEPA will analyze these errors and automatically refine the prompt to address common failure patterns, potentially boosting accuracy by 10-20 percentage points."

    "GEPA (Generalized Error-driven Prompt Augmentation) is an automatic prompt optimization technique that learns from mistakes to improve model performance. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The GEPA Optimization Cycle:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Evaluation Phase** - Run the model on training examples and collect predictions\n",
    "2. **Error Analysis** - Identify which problems the model got wrong\n",
    "3. **Feedback Generation** - Create detailed feedback explaining:\n",
    "   - What the correct answer should be\n",
    "   - Why the model's answer was wrong\n",
    "   - The complete step-by-step solution\n",
    "4. **Reflection Phase** - Use the reflection LM (Qwen3 Thinking) to:\n",
    "   - Analyze patterns across multiple failed examples\n",
    "   - Identify common failure modes (e.g., \"model miscalculates ratios\", \"model misinterprets word problems\")\n",
    "   - Generate improved prompt instructions to address these patterns\n",
    "5. **Prompt Update** - Modify the system prompt with new guidelines\n",
    "6. **Validation** - Test the updated prompt on validation set\n",
    "7. **Iteration** - Repeat the cycle, keeping only improvements that boost validation accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why We Need `metric_with_feedback`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a standard metric that just returns 0 or 1 (correct/incorrect), `metric_with_feedback` returns:\n",
    "- **Score**: 0 or 1 for correctness\n",
    "- **Feedback**: Rich textual explanation including the ground truth solution\n",
    "\n",
    "This feedback is crucial because GEPA's reflection model needs to understand *why* predictions failed to generate better prompts. The more detailed the feedback, the better GEPA can identify patterns and create targeted improvements.\n",

    "**Key Parameters:**\n",
    "- `auto=\"light\"`: Controls optimization intensity (light/medium/heavy)\n",
    "- `reflection_minibatch_size=16`: Number of errors analyzed together per reflection\n",
    "- `reflection_lm`: The smarter model used for analyzing errors and improving prompts\n",

With more training data (`sample_fraction=0.01` or higher) and heavier optimization (`auto=\"medium\"` or `\"heavy\"`), we'd expect 15-25% improvements, potentially reaching 65-70% accuracy."
