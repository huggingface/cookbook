      "    reasoning='A Beaver-number is defined as a five-digit integer whose digit sum is divisible by 17. A Beaver-pair consists of two Beaver-numbers differing by exactly 1, with the smaller called an MIT Beaver and the larger a CIT Beaver. We need to find the range of CIT Beavers across all such pairs, specifically the difference between the largest and smallest CIT Beavers.\\n\\nTo analyze this, consider two consecutive integers n and n+1 differing by 1. For both to be Beaver-numbers, their digit sums must both be divisible by 17 (since the sum of digits of n and n+1 must both satisfy this property).\\n\\nLet s(n) be the digit sum of n, and s(n+1) be that of n+1. The difference:\\n\\ns(n+1) - s(n) = (sum of digits of n+1) - (sum of digits of n)\\n\\nAdding 1 to n affects the digit sum depending on the structure of the number:\\n\\n- If the last digit of n before addition is less than 9, then s(n+1) = s(n) + 1.\\n- If the last digit of n is 9, then that digit becomes 0 and the previous digit increments by 1. This leads to a recursive carry-over:\\n\\n  s(n+1) = s(n) - 9 + 1 = s(n) - 8\\n\\nbecause one 9 digit turns into 0 (subtract 9), and one digit increases by 1 (adding 1). The net change is -8 overall.\\n\\n---\\n\\nFor both s(n) and s(n+1) to be divisible by 17:\\n\\n- Case 1: last digit < 9\\n\\n  s(n+1) = s(n) + 1\\n\\n  Both divisible by 17:\\n\\n  s(n) ≡ 0 mod 17  \\n  s(n+1) = s(n) + 1 ≡ 0 mod 17 ⇒ s(n) + 1 ≡ 0 mod 17\\n\\n  Combining these:\\n\\n  s(n) ≡ 0 mod 17\\n  s(n) + 1 ≡ 0 mod 17 ⇒ s(n) ≡ -1 ≡ 16 mod 17\\n\\n  Contradiction because s(n) cannot be both 0 and 16 mod 17 simultaneously.\\n\\n- Case 2: last digit is 9\\n\\n  s(n+1) = s(n) - 8\\n\\n  Both divisible by 17:\\n\\n  s(n) ≡ 0 mod 17\\n  s(n) - 8 ≡ 0 mod 17 ⇒ s(n) ≡ 8 mod 17\\n\\n  Again, contradictory: s(n) cannot be both 0 and 8 mod 17.\\n\\nTherefore, there are no n for which both s(n) and s(n+1) are divisible by 17.\\n\\n**But wait**, this contradicts initial reasoning. Since digit sum changes as described, and the sum of digits modulo 17 must be preserved or satisfy certain difference conditions, perhaps I need to approach differently.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAlternatively, consider that for both n and n+1, s(n) and s(n+1) are divisible by 17:\\n\\nFrom the earlier calculations:\\n\\n- When the last digit is less than 9:\\n\\n  s(n+1) = s(n) + 1\\n\\n  For both to be divisible by 17:\\n\\n  s(n) ≡ 0 mod 17  \\n  s(n) + 1 ≡ 0 mod 17 ⇒ s(n) ≡ -1 ≡ 16 mod 17\\n\\n  Contradicts s(n) ≡ 0 mod 17 unless both are zero mod 17 but s(n)+1 ≡ 0 mod 17 implies s(n) ≡ 16 mod 17.\\n\\nHence, **it\\'s impossible** for both s(n) and s(n)+1 to be divisible by 17 if the last digit < 9.\\n\\n- When last digit is 9:\\n\\n  s(n+1) = s(n) - 8\\n\\n  For both being divisible by 17:\\n\\n  s(n) ≡ 0 mod 17  \\n  s(n) - 8 ≡ 0 mod 17 ⇒ s(n) ≡ 8 mod 17\\n\\nContradicts s(n) ≡ 0 mod 17 unless 0 ≡ 8 mod 17, which is false.\\n\\nThus, in both cases, it appears impossible for two consecutive integers to both have digit sums divisible by 17.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nSince the digit sum change when adding 1 to n cannot be simultaneously divisible by 17 for both n and n + 1, it is impossible for two adjacent integers to both be Beaver-numbers with digit sum divisible by 17, including such pairs differing by 1.\\n\\n**Wait**, but the problem states that a pair differs by **exactly** 1. Since the only possible difference in the digit sum when increasing by 1 is ±1 or -8 (due to carryover), and the digit sums need to satisfy divisibility by 17, the only way for both to be Beaver-numbers is if the change in digit sum is 0 mod 17.\\n\\nTesting this:\\n\\n- If the digit sum change is 1, then:\\n\\n  s(n+1) ≡ s(n) + 1 ≡ 0 mod 17 → s(n) ≡ -1 ≡ 16 mod 17\\n\\n  So s(n) ≡ 16 mod 17.\\n\\n  But then s(n+1) ≡ 0 mod 17, which violates the initial assumption that both are Beaver-numbers (being divisible by 17).\\n\\n- Similarly, for the carry-over case:\\n\\n  s(n+1) = s(n) - 8\\n\\n  If s(n) ≡ 0 mod 17, then s(n+1) ≡ -8 ≡ 9 mod 17, not 0, so only one of them has sum divisible by 17.\\n\\n**\\nThus, **conclusion is that no pair of Beaver-numbers differ by exactly 1**.\\n\\nHold on—initial assumptions were off. The problem asks for pairs of Beaver-numbers differing by exactly 1. The only way for both to have digit sums divisible by 17 is when the digit sum stays the same (difference zero mod 17). The only way for the sum of digits to be equal when incremented by 1 (or decremented by 1) is impossible unless digit sum remains unchanged, which doesn\\'t happen in a decimal increment, except possibly under specific circumstances.\\n\\nBut considering that the problem explicitly defines \"a pair differing by exactly 1\" as a pair where their numerical difference is 1, and both are Beaver-numbers, then as shown, no such pair exists.\\n\\nBut since the problem explicitly gives the task to find the positive difference between the largest and smallest CIT Beavers, it implies that such pairs do exist, and the key is in the digit sum divisible by 17.\\n\\nGiven the above reasoning, the only possible approach is to target the minimal and maximal CIT Beavers associated with such Beaver-pairs.\\n\\nNote that the largest five-digit number is 99999 and the smallest 10000.\\n\\nLet\\'s examine possible candidate Beard-number(s):\\n\\n- The digit sum is divisible by 17:\\n\\n  For 10000: digit sum = 1, not divisible by 17.\\n\\n  For 99999: digit sum = 9+9+9+9+9=45; 45/17 ≠ integer.\\n\\n- Let\\'s check 99999: digit sum 45, 45 mod 17 = 45 - 2*17= 45-34=11: no.\\n\\n- For 10000: sum=1 → no.\\n\\nWe need to identify five-digit numbers with digit sum divisible by 17.\\n\\nPossible sums:\\n\\n- 17 (minimum sum larger than 0, since 1-digit sum)\\n\\n- 34 (max sum: 9+9+9+9+9=45), 45 mod 17 ≠ 0.\\n\\nCheck sums:\\n\\n- 17\\n\\n- 34\\n\\n- 51 (exceeds 45, so unpossible for 5 digit numbers)\\n\\nDigits for sum=17:\\n\\n- The smallest 5-digit number with digit sum=17:\\n\\n  For example, 10008: sum=1+0+0+0+8=9 ≠17.\\n\\n- Try to construct such numbers systematically.\\n\\nTo find the minimal Beaver-number:\\n\\n- Minimize the number; larger digits at left position produce bigger number, so for minimal number, set as small as possible:\\n\\nStart with 10000: sum=1. Need sum=17, so need to add 16 more via the last 4 digits.\\n\\nSet last four digits such that sum + 1 (the first digit) =17\\n\\nThis suggests:\\n\\n- First digit = 1\\n- Sum of last four digits = 16\\n\\nNow, look for last four digits adding up to 16, with each digit ≤9.\\n\\nPossible choices:\\n\\n- 9,7,0,0 (sum=16), number 10700 (digits 1,0,7,0,0):\\n\\n  sum: 1+0+7+0+0=8≠17. No.\\n\\n- 9,9,0,0: sum=18 >16, no.\\n\\n- 8,8,0,0 sum=16, digits are 8+8+0+0=16.\\n\\nNumber: first digit 1, last four digits 8,8,0,0:\\n\\nNumber: 11880\\n\\nSum: 1+1+8+8+0=18≠17; no.\\n\\nAlternate last four digits:\\n\\n- 9,7,0,0 sum=16; number 10700, sum ≠17.\\n\\nWait, but the sum is 1 (first digit) + 8+8+0+0=17, exactly.\\n\\nNumber: 18800, sum: 1+8+8+0+0=17.\\n\\nCheck if 18800 is a Beaver-number:\\n\\ndigit sum=17, check if 18800 is five-digit number: yes, number is ≥ 10,000.\\n\\nNumber: 18800, sum: 1+8+8+0+0=17.\\n\\nOK, so 18800 is a candidate.\\n\\nNow, check whether n=18800 has a neighbor n+1=18801 that is also a Beaver-number (digit sum divisible by 17).\\n\\ns(18800)=17.\\n\\ns(18801)=1+8+8+0+1=18. Not divisible by 17.\\n\\nSimilarly, 18800-1=18799:\\n\\ns(18799)=1+8+7+9+9=34, which is divisible by 17? 17*2=34, yes.\\n\\nBut 18799 is less than 18800, and sum is 34, so it is a Beaver-number.\\n\\nSo the numbers 18799 and 18800 are consecutive numbers with digit sums 34 and 17 respectively. But they differ by 1? 18800 - 18799=1.\\n\\nNumber 18800 sum:17, number 18799 sum:34; only 18800 is a Beaver-number if digit sum 17? Yes.\\n\\nDoes 18799 have digit sum 34? Yes, sum is 1+8+7+9+9=34.\\n\\nBut 18800: 1+8+8+0+0=17, so both meet the digit sum divisible by 17.\\n\\nAre both numbers Beaver? Yes, because their digit sums are divisible by 17.\\n\\nNumber 18799: sum=34, divisible by 17.\\n\\nNumber 18800: sum=17, divisible by 17.\\n\\nDifference: 1, and the smaller is 18799, larger 18800.\\n\\nThus, the pair (18799, 18800) is a Beaver-pair with difference 1.\\n\\nSimilarly, the larger number is 18800 (CIT Beaver), the smallest CIT Beaver in such a pair.\\n\\nNow, for the maximal CIT Beaver, look for the highest Beaver-number with the same property—sum divisible by 17.\\n\\nAttempt the maximum digit sum:\\n\\n- 45 (sum of 9+9+9+9+9), 45/17 ≈ 2.647 which is not integer.\\n\\n- Check sum=34 (which is 17*2)\\n\\nFind the largest five-digit number with digit sum 34:\\n\\n- Maximize digits, starting with 9, then with 8s, etc.\\n\\nNumber: 99880: sum=9+9+8+8+0=34, so 99880 is a candidate.\\n\\nCheck its neighbor: 99881,\\n\\nsum: 9+9+8+8+1=35, not divisible by 17.\\n\\nSimilarly, check previous number: 99879, sum 9+9+8+7+9=42, no.\\n\\nEstimate the maximum such number with sum=34:\\n\\nNumber: 99880, sum=34.\\n\\nCheck:\\n\\n- Is 99880 divisible by 17? Let\\'s check s(99880)=34, but that doesn\\'t guarantee number divisibility by 17.\\n\\nThe problem specifies only digit sum divisible by 17. No mention that the number itself must be divisible by 17.\\n\\nGiven that, the only restriction is that the digit sum is divisible by 17.\\n\\nTherefore, for the CIT Beaver, the largest number with digit sum divisible by 17 (say 34) and in five digits, is 99880. For the pair involving 99880, the previous number is 99879 with sum 42, which is not divisible by 17, so not a Beacon-number.\\n\\nSimilarly, check slightly lower:\\n\\nNumber 99850: sum=9+9+8+5+0=31, no.\\n\\nNumber 99884: sum=9+9+8+8+4=38, no.\\n\\nOur first candidate: 99880 with sum=34.\\n\\nNow, check the next neighbor: 99881:\\n\\nsum=9+9+8+8+1=35, no.\\n\\nSo 99880\\'s neighbor 99881 is not a Beaver-number; thus the number 99880 does not have an adjacent Beaver-number differing by 1.\\n\\nSimilarly, try the 17-based sums.\\n\\nEarlier, we saw that for the smallest Beaver-number with digit sum 17: 18800.\\n\\nAnd the neighboring number 18801 has digit sum 18, not divisible by 17.\\n\\nSo the number 18800 is the smallest Beaver-number with sum divisible by 17 that appears with such a neighbor.\\n\\nNow, the previous number with sum 34 is 18799.\\n\\nNumber 18799:\\n\\n- sum=1+8+7+9+9=34, divisible by 17 (since 17*2=34).\\n\\nAnd 18800:\\n\\n- sum=1+8+8+0+0=17.\\n\\nCompare: 18799 and 18800:\\n\\nDifference of 1, both numbers are Beaver-numbers.\\n\\nSimilarly, their sums:\\n\\n- 18799: sum=34 (divisible by 17)\\n- 18800: sum=17 (divisible by 17)\\n\\nHence, the pair (18799,18800) is a Beaver-pair with difference 1, the smaller being 18799, the larger 18800.\\n\\nSimilarly, the CIT Beaver is 18800.\\n\\nFrom earlier, since such pairs exist, the possible largest CIT Beaver is 18800.\\n\\nBut maybe there exists a larger one.\\n\\nLet\\'s try to find larger candidate CIT Beavers with digit sum divisible by 17.\\n\\nNumber: 99999, sum=45, 45/17 ≈ 2.647, so no.\\n\\nNext plausible: 99989 (sum: 9+9+9+8+9=44), no.\\n\\n99990 sum: 9+9+9+9+0=36, no.\\n\\nProceeding backwards, find the next number with sum=34:\\n\\n- 99880: sum=34, as previous.\\n\\nNumber: 99880.\\n\\nWould 99881 have sum=9+9+8+8+1=35 no.\\n\\nSimilarly, the only candidate with sum=34 above 99880 is 99880 itself.\\n\\nHence, the maximum CIT Beaver is 99880.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n\\n- The smallest CIT Beaver corresponds to the pair (18799, 18800), with CIT Beaver = 18800.\\n- The largest CIT Beaver possible in such a pair is 99880.\\n\\nThe problem asks for the positive difference between the largest and smallest CIT Beavers over all Beaver-pairs:\\n\\nDifference = 99880 - 18800 = 81080.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Final answer: \\\\(\\\\boxed{81080}\\\\)',\n",

      "\n",
      "1. The first term: \\(g(x) = \\frac{a+\\sin x}{2+\\cos x}\\).\n",
      "   - Since \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\) are bounded between -1 and 1, the numerator varies between \\(a-1\\) and \\(a+1\\).\n",
      "   - The denominator \\(2+\\cos x\\) varies between 1 and 3.\n",
      "   - The fraction thus takes values depending on \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\); it can be analyzed for extremal values.\n",

      "2. The second term: \\(b \\tan x\\).\n",
      "   - \\(\\tan x\\) varies from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\), but for ensuring the maximum and minimum of \\(f(x)\\) exist finitely, the term involving \\(\\tan x\\) must have a bounded contribution, or the problem assumes the extremal values occur at specific points where \\(\\tan x\\) approaches infinity, leading \\(f(x)\\) to unbounded values unless \\(b=0\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in typical optimization with a trigonometric function, the maximum and minimum values are realized at points where derivatives vanish or at boundary points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the symmetry and the appearance of \\(\\tan x\\), the maximum and minimum of \\(f(x)\\) will be dominated by the term \\(\\frac{a+\\sin x}{2+\\cos x}\\) in the case \\(b=0\\), since otherwise, the function can become unbounded unless \\(b=0\\).\n",

      "Since adding the \\(b \\tan x\\) term would lead to unbounded extremal values unless \\(b=0\\), and considering the problem's wording about the sum of maximum and minimum being 4, it suggests that the contribution of \\(b \\tan x\\) to these extremal values cancels out or is zero, hence \\(b=0\\).\n",
