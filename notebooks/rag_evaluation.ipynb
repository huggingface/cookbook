    "# RAG Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how you can evaluate your RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), by building a synthetic evaluation dataset and using LLM-as-a-judge to compute the accuracy of your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a Large Language Model (LLM) to answer questions about a particular field of knowledge, two issues may appear:\n",
    "- the LLM not having knowledge of domain-specific information due to it not being available in its training data\n",
    "- the risk of hallucination: when asked to give an answer on an unknown field, the LLM may hallucinate a credible answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two problems can be tempered by fine-tuning the LLM on the said field of knowledge\n",
    "However, fine-tuning can be costly, and, when done repeatedly (e.g. to address changes in data), leads to \"model shift\" _(this is when the model's behavior changes in ways that are not desirable)_.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) does not require model fine-tuning. Instead, RAG works by enhancing an LLM with access to additional context retrieved from relevant data, so that it can generate a better-informed response.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG systems consists of two subsystems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A Retriever system, functioning like an internal search engine, identifies the most relevant documents from the knowledge base to respond to the query.\n",
    "2. A Reader Language Model (LLM) reads these retrieved documents to produce an answer to the user’s query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the workflow, with paths for system tuning noted in blue:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/cookbook-images/resolve/main/RAG_graph.png\" height=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 As you can see, there are many steps to tune in this architecture: tuning the system properly will yield significant performance gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG systems have plentiful options for improvement: you can tune your system along the way to improve results beyond a baseline model.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is useless if you cannot monitor the impact of your changes on the system's performance!\n",
    "\n",
    "__Let's dig into it and start building our evaluation pipeline!__ First, we install the required model dependancies."
