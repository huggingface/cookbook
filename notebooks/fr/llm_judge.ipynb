    "# Utilisation d'un *LLM-as-a-judge* üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è pour une √©valuation automatis√©e et polyvalente \n",

    "L'√©valuation des grands mod√®les de langage (LLM) est souvent une entreprise difficile : compte tenu de leurs vastes capacit√©s, les t√¢ches qui leur sont confi√©es doivent souvent √™tre jug√©es sur la base d'exigences tr√®s larges et peu pr√©cises. Par exemple, la r√©ponse d'un assistant √† une question peut √™tre :\n",
    "- non fond√©e sur le contexte\n",
    "- r√©p√©titive, r√©p√©titive, r√©p√©titive\n",
    "- grammaticalement incorrecte\n",
    "- excessivement longue et caract√©ris√©e par une surabondance de mots, conduisant √† une situation o√π le discours ou le contenu √©crit devient excessivement d√©taill√© et prolong√©\n",
    "- incoh√©rent\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "La liste des crit√®res est encore longue. Et m√™me si nous disposions d'une liste limit√©e, chacun d'entre eux serait difficile √† mesurer : ¬´ concevoir un programme bas√© sur des r√®gles pour √©valuer les sorties est extr√™mement difficile. Les mesures d'√©valuation traditionnelles bas√©es sur la similarit√© entre les r√©sultats et les r√©ponses de r√©f√©rence (par exemple, [ROUGE](https://hf.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/rouge), [BLEU](https://hf.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/bleu)) sont √©galement inefficaces pour ces questions. ¬ª\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Une solution puissante pour √©valuer les sorties d'une mani√®re humaine, sans n√©cessiter de temps humain co√ªteux, est l'utilisation d'un *LLM-as-a-judge* (qu'on d√©signera simplement ¬´ juge ¬ª par la suite) c'est-√†-dire d'un second mod√®le pour juger les sorties du premier mod√®le.\n",

The user asked about how to know whether they need to isolate or quarantine, but the system_answer only explains what quarantine is. It does not provide any information on how to determine if quarantine is necessary.\\nTotal rating:  2  \n",
