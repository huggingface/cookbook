        "# Simple RAG for GitHub issues using Hugging Face Zephyr and LangChain\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how you can quickly build a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for a project's GitHub issues using [`HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta`](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta) model, and LangChain.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**What is RAG?**\n",
        "\n",
        "RAG is a popular approach to address the issue of a powerful LLM not being aware of specific content due to said content not being in its training data, or hallucinating even when it has seen it before. Such specific content may be proprietary, sensitive, or, as in this example, recent and updated often.\n",
        "\n",
        "If your data is static and doesn't change regularly, you may consider fine-tuning a large model. In many cases, however, fine-tuning can be costly, and, when done repeatedly (e.g. to address data drift), leads to \"model shift\". This is when the model's behavior changes in ways that are not desirable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** does not require model fine-tuning. Instead, RAG works by providing an LLM with additional context that is retrieved from relevant data so that it can generate a better-informed response.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a quick illustration:\n",
        "\n",
        "![RAG diagram](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/os-ai-cookbook-rag-diagram.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "* The external data is converted into embedding vectors with a separate embeddings model, and the vectors are kept in a database. Embeddings models are typically small, so updating the embedding vectors on a regular basis is faster, cheaper, and easier than fine-tuning a model.\n",
        "\n",
        "* At the same time, the fact that fine-tuning is not required gives you the freedom to swap your LLM for a more powerful one when it becomes available, or switch to a smaller distilled version, should you need faster inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's illustrate building a RAG using an open-source LLM, embeddings model, and LandChain.\n",
        "\n",

              "\" To combine multiple adapters, you need to ensure that they are compatible with each other and the devices you want to connect. Here's how you can do it:\\n\\n1. Identify the adapters you need: Determine which adapters you require to connect the devices you want to use. For example, if you want to connect a USB-C device to an HDMI monitor, you may need a USB-C to HDMI adapter and a USB-C to USB-A adapter (if your computer doesn't have a USB-C port).\\n\\n2. Connect the first adapter: Plug in the first adapter into the device you want to connect. For instance, if you're connecting a laptop to a monitor, plug the USB-C to HDMI adapter into your laptop's USB-C port.\\n\\n3. Connect the second adapter: If necessary, connect the second adapter to the first one. In our example, you would connect the USB-C to USB-A adapter to the USB-C port on the USB-C to HDMI adapter.\\n\\n4. Connect the final device: Finally, connect the device you want to use to the second adapter. In our case, you would connect the HDMI cable from the monitor to the HDMI port on the USB-C to HDMI adapter.\\n\\n5. Test the connection: Turn on both devices and check whether everything is working correctly. You should now be able to use the connected device as normal.\\n\\nRemember to always check compatibility before purchasing any adapters to ensure they will work together and with your specific devices.\""

Here are some insights from the issues raised:\\n\\n  1. In issue #1040, AlbertoZerbinati asks about merging multiple adapters, suggesting that it might be useful to add multiple distinct behaviors to a base model by merging multiple Lora adapters. However, no clear recommendation was given.\\n\\n  2. In issue #1025, Ali1858 encountered a ValueError while trying to load multiple adapters simultaneously for inference. This suggests that currently, loading multiple adapters at once may not be supported or straightforward.\\n\\n  3. In issue #449, TheShy-Dream expressed interest in incorporating multimodal information into an adapter they were creating themselves. It's unclear whether this involves combining multiple adapters or just modifying a single one.\\n\\n   Overall, it seems that combining multiple adapters is still an open question, and more exploration and experimentation is needed to determine how best to do it. If you're interested in contributing to this discussion, you might consider joining the conversation in these issues or opening a new one with your own ideas and questions.\""
