    "# RAG Evaluation\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how you can evaluate your RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), by building a synthetic evaluation dataset and using LLM-as-a-judge to compute the accuracy of your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an introduction to RAG, you can check [this other cookbook](rag_zephyr_langchain)!\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG systems are complex: here a RAG diagram, where we noted in blue all possibilities for system enhancement:\n",

    "<img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/cookbook-images/resolve/main/RAG_workflow.png\" height=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing any of these improvements can bring a huge performance boost; but changing anything is useless if you cannot monitor the impact of your changes on the system's performance!\n",

    "### Evaluating RAG performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are so many moving parts to tune with a big impact on performance, benchmarking the RAG system is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our evaluation pipeline, we will need:\n",
    "1. An evaluation dataset with question - answer couples (QA couples)\n",
    "2. An evaluator to compute the accuracy of our system on the above evaluation dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚û°Ô∏è It turns out, we can use LLMs to help us all along the way!\n",
    "1. The evaluation dataset will be synthetically generated by an LLM ü§ñ, and questions will be filtered out by other LLMs ü§ñ\n",
    "2. An [LLM-as-a-judge](https://huggingface.co/papers/2306.05685) agent ü§ñ will then perform the evaluation on this synthetic dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Let's dig into it and start building our evaluation pipeline!__ First, we install the required model dependancies."
